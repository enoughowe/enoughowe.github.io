Here is **Li Shuhao (李书豪)**.

I am a Ph.D candidate in the School of Journalism & Communication at Nanjing University, advised by [Prof. Zhou Kai](https://jc.nju.edu.cn/info/1641/2271.htm). I graduated from the Department of Film & TV Art at Central Academy of Drama, majoring in Drama and Film Studies.

During my master's degree, I did an internship at Monkey Dirty Film Studios. After graduation, I took a teaching position at Communication University of China, Nanjing (aka [CUCN](https://www.cucn.edu.cn/#/Home)).
